Save [`t0.html`](https://github.com/zabop/mapboxDebug/blob/master/topics/t0.html) and open it in a browser. Make sure you see a green square.

Edit the file to achieve the following.

1. Make the square red
2. Make the square blue and somewhat transparent.

Now look at `raster-color-range` ([docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/layers/#paint-raster-raster-color-range)).
